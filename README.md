## Description 

The front end for this application was provided by BCS, and I wrote the back end javascript that connected the frontend to the express.js server. 

The application uses GET, POST, and DELETE api requests in order to read, update, and delete notes in the application! 

The application stores notes with unique ids in a JSON file. 

Finally, the application was deployed on Heroku for easy access.
